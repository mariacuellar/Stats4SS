# **Statistics for the Social Sciences**

This is a template example for lab journaling. Students in Crim 250: Statistics for the Social Sciences will use this template to learn R and statistics.

## How to use


# Getting Started
Before we meet for our next class there are few things you should try at home to get started.

1. Download and install R on your computer. This is the R website https://www.r-project.org

2. Download and install R-studio. You must download and install R first before installing R-studio. The R-studio website is https://www.rstudio.com

3. Create a free github account. The github website is https://github.com

4. Download and install github desktop https://desktop.github.com

5. At this point you should have downloaded R and R-studio to your own computer. This will allow you to run R and R-studio locally. It is also possible to run R-studio in the cloud through your web-browser. To do this you need to create an account with R-studio cloud. Create an account here https://rstudio.cloud. Note: In class we will be using a computer lab wit R-studio installed on the computers. You will have the option of using the lab computer, or bringing your own laptop, and/or using R-studio through the cloud.

Donâ€™t worry if you ran into issues with these first steps, we will address them in class on Monday.
